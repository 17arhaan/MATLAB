var(x) Calculates the variance of the data in x
sort(x) -Sorts the elements of a vector x into ascending order
sort(x,'descend')- Sorts the elements in descending order (column wise for matrix)
sortrows(x) -Sorts the rows in a matrix in ascending order based on the values in the first column, and keeps each row intact
sortrows(x,n) - Sorts the rows in a matrix on the basis of the values in column n
factor(x) - Finds the prime factors of x.
